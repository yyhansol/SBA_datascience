Ali Qaddafiddam had failed in efforts to recruit fighters among the\\nEgyptian population living immediately across the border with Libya.\\nThese individuals added that during the week of February 21 the Libyan Leader spoke to Syrian\\nPresident Bashir al-Assad on at least three occasions by secure telephone lines. During the\\nconversations Qaddafi asked that Syrian officers and technicians currently training the Libyan\\nAir Force be placed under command of the Libyan Army and allowed to fight against the rebel\\nforces.\\n(Source Comment: Senior Libyan Army officers still loyal to Qaddafi added that On February\\n23, President Assad told General Isam Hallaq, the commander in chief of the Syrian Air Force,\\nto instruct the pilots and technicians in Tripoli to help the Libyan regime, should full scale Civil\\nWar breaks out in the immediate future.)\\nOn March 2, a military officer with ties to Qaddfi\\'s son Khamis stated privately that the number\\nof Libyan pilots defecting to the opposition has destroyed the morale and professional spirit of\\nthe Libyan Air Force at this critical moment, when Tripoli\\'s air superiority is its principal weapon\\nagainst insurgents. In the opinion of this individual Qaddafi and his senior military advisors are\\nconvinced that the European Union and the U.S will impose a no-fly zone over Libya in the\\nimmediate future. These advisors believe that the no fly zone will serve as air support for\\nopposition forces. They are also prepared for the Western allies to bomb anti-aircraft facilities in\\nand around Tripoli in preparation for the establishment of the no-fly zone. Foreign Minister\\nMousa Kousa is convinced that that Russia and Turkey will oppose the move, and may prevent\\nthe implementation of the no fly zone.\\nThe Syrian soldiers in Libya are part of a mission established in 1984 following the signing of a\\nmilitary agreement between Qaddafi and Syria\\'s long-time ruler and Bashir\\'s father, Hafez al-\\nAssad, in the presence of General Soubhi Haddad, who was the commander in chief of the Air\\nForce at the time. Both Air Forces are equipped with Russian materiel and have had long-\\nstanding, close links with Moscow.\\nNote from David Owen, former UK foreign secretary\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739546\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Libyan money\\nhelped Hafez al-Assad bribe his brother Rifaat, the author of an attempted coup d\\'etat in 1983,\\nto leave the country and go into exile in Spain and France, where he has remained ever since.\\nAccording to individuals with access to the Syrian military, Damascus has also sent a second\\nteam of pilots and technicians to Tripoli. These are lower-ranking officers loyal to the regime\\nwho are specialized in flying helicopters. Before their departure for Tripoli on February 23, they\\nmet with General Allaq and General Jamil Hasan, head of Air Force\\'s Intelligence.\\n(Source Comment: During the afternoon of 3 March, an associate of Saif al-Islam Qaddafi\\nstated that he and the Libyan leaders other family members were concerned over the\\nannouncement of Jose Luis Moreno-Ocampo, chief prosecutor of the International Criminal\\nCourt (ICC), announced that he was investigating Qaddafi, his sons Khamis, the commander of\\nthe 32 battalion, and Montasem, as well as the head of Gadhafi\\'s personal security detail, the\\nDirector-General of the External Security Organization (Abuzaid Dorda), the spokesman of the\\nregime (Musa Ibrahim), and the Minister of Foreign Affairs (Mousa Kousa). This source added\\nthat Saif al-Islam had said that Qaddafi himself found the announcement amusing.)\\nFrom: Lord Owen\\nCody,\\nRealistically the UN will not authorise a no fly zone while Gaddafi continues to hold off bombing and\\nstrafing but keeping it up front and on the military agenda keeps him worried. Yet for a few frustrating months\\nthat ambivalence kept the Serbian aeroplanes on the ground before we acted. My hope is that preparations\\ncontinue with visuals of planes flying off carriers, airborne early warning planes flying and people with clout\\noutside the Administration demanding preparations. But and it is a big BUT what else can and should we be\\ndoing? Encourage humanitarian ships and convoys from Egypt to bring in supplies since we must ensure the\\ncities in the East can hold up living standards, maybe for months. More adventurous, Egyptian Special Forces to\\ngo in and advise, even supplying hand held missiles. It appears they have few missiles; the military in the East\\nhaving been deliberately kept ill-equipped. There is old Nasserite sentiment for a Federation of Egypt, Sudan\\nand Libya. I know some will say Egypt has enough problems and they should stay resolutely focused on\\ndomestic reforms. it is delicate but words alone and the balance of advantage will slip to Gaddafi. A Gaddafi\\nvictory is possible and needs to be weighed in the balance now when deciding what to do.\\nI\\'m more worried than I am ready to say publicly.\\nYours\\nDavid\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739546\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Alongside our men and women in uniform, they represent the\\nbest traditions of a bold and generous nation.\\nIn the lobby of this building, the State Department, the names of those who have fallen in the line of duty are inscribed\\nin marble. Our hearts break over each one. And now, because of this tragedy, we have new heroes to honor and more\\nfriends to mourn.\\nChris Stevens fell in love with the Middle East as a young Peace Corps volunteer teaching English in Morocco. He joined\\nthe Foreign Service, learned languages, won friends for America in distant places, and made other people\\'s hopes his\\nown.\\nIn the early days of the Libyan revolution, I asked Chris to be our envoy to the rebel opposition. He arrived on a cargo\\nship in the port of Benghazi and began building our relationships with Libya\\'s revolutionaries. He risked his life to stop a\\ntyrant, then gave his life trying to help build a better Libya. The world needs more Chris Stevenses. I spoke with his\\nsister, Ann, this morning, and told her that he will be remembered as a hero by many nations.\\nSean Smith was an Air Force veteran. He spent 10 years as an information management officer in the State Department,\\nhe was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary assignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather,\\nwith whom I spoke this morning. He was a father to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being\\nproud of the service their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and finally to\\nBenghazi.\\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary, and we arid the people\\nof Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy. Today, many Americans are asking indeed, I asked\\nmyself ??how could this happen? How could this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from\\ndestruction? This question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be\\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group ??not the people or\\nGovernment of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a country scarred by war and tyranny, they were\\nhailed as friends and partners. And when the attack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post, Some\\nwere wounded. Libyans carried Chris\\' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to safety.\\nAnd last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the violence and pledged every effort\\nto protect our people and pursue those responsible.\\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty of this attack. A free\\nand stable Libya is still in America\\'s interest and security, and we will not turn our back on that nor will we rest until\\nthose responsible for these attacks are found and brought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities\\nto move swiftly and surely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American embassies,\\nconsulates, and citizens.\\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher priority than protecting our\\nmen and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine the precise motivations and methods of those who\\ncarried out this assault. Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our\\nEmbassy in Cairo yesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the Internet. America\\'s commitment to\\nreligious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear ?봳here is no justification for this,\\nnone. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long as there are those who would take innocent life\\nin the name of God, the world will never know a true and lasting peace.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739562\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf\\ntold senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist\\nmilitia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National\\nCongress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf\\nbelieves that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to\\ndemonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security\\nofficials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia\\ngroup calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the\\nEastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that\\nthis group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group\\n(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhakim Belhaj. The\\nsame officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had\\nany direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to\\nwhether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai\\'da\\nleader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme.

According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a\\nstatement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the internet film was\\ngoing to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult\\nMuslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in\\n2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.\\nEmbassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting\\nfrom security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia\\nfighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of\\nabout 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under\\ncover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with\\nrocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El\\nMagariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that\\nhe had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohm_med Morsi, and the two\\nagreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.\\n(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was\\norganized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence\\nof such a complex operation at this time.\\n3.(Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security\\nofficers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for\\napproximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early\\ndemonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

These officials add that government security officers\\nadmitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,\\nattack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these\\nforces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in\\nAfghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and\\nLibyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia\\'s are\\nbetter armed than the forces of the new National Army.\\n4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that\\nthe attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion\\nof the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western\\nintelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al\\nQaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.\\nAmbassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to\\ndisarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi\\nbeliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western\\nintelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate\\nwith their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for\\nU.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry\\npublic reaction that is sure to follow.\\n5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in\\nprivate conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a\\nsenior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up\\nnew operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes\\nthat a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai\\'da and other\\nradical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739563\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.\\nIn the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus\\non this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.\\nand other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and\\nreplacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders.

On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf\\ntold senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist\\nmilitia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National\\nCongress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf\\nbelieves that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to\\ndemonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security\\nofficials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia\\ngroup calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the\\nEastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that\\nthis group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group\\n(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abdelhaldm Belhaj. The\\nsame officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had\\nany direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to\\nwhether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qarda\\nleader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme. These officials do\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739565\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.\\nEmbassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting\\nfrom security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia\\nfighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of\\nabout 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under\\ncover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with\\nrocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El\\nMagariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that\\nhe had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two\\nagreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.\\n(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was\\norganized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence\\nof such a complex operation at this time.\\n3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security\\nofficers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for\\napproximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early\\ndemonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

These officials add that government security officers\\nadmitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,\\nattack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these\\nforces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in\\nAfghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and\\nLibyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia\\'s are\\nbetter armed than the forces of the new National Army.\\n4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that\\nthe attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion\\nof the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western\\nintelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al\\nQadclafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.\\nAmbassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to\\ndisarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi\\nbeliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western\\nintelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate\\nwith their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for\\nU.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry\\npublic reaction that is sure to follow.\\n5. (Source comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in\\nprivate conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a\\nsenior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up\\nnew operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes\\nthat a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qarcla and other\\nradical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739565\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.\\nIn the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus\\non this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.\\nand other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and\\nreplacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders.

Daaider, argues that stopping\\nColonel Qaddafi\\'s air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi\\'s own calculations about\\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\\noffer of a negotiated departure.\\nIf it does work, we don\\'t know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama\\'s\\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\\nLet\\'s arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\\n\\'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary\\'s reluctance to\\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739568\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Assuming that a no-flight zone can be imposed by an international coalition that\\nincludes Arab states, we have an opportunity to establish a new narrative of Western support for Arab\\ndemocrats.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739568\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Daaider, argues that stopping\\nColonel Qaddafi\\'s air force will not be decisive; he will continue to inflict damage with tanks and\\nhelicopters, bombing oil refineries and depots on his way to retaking key towns. But the potential\\neffect of a no-flight zone must also be assessed in terms of Colonel Qaddafi\\'s own calculations about\\nhis future. Richard Downie of the Center for Strategic and International Studies argues that although\\nColonel Qaddafi cultivates a mad-dictator image, he has been a canny survivor and political\\nmanipulator for 40 years. He is aware of debates with regard to a no-flight zone and is timing his\\nmilitary campaign accordingly; he is also capable of using his air force just enough to gain strategic\\nadvantage, but not enough to trigger a no-flight zone. If the international community lines up against\\nhim and is willing to crater his runways and take out his antiaircraft weapons, he might well renew his\\noffer of a negotiated departure.\\nIf it does work, we don\\'t know what we will get. Revolutions are almost always followed by internal\\ndivisions among the revolutionaries. We should not expect a rosy, Jeffersonian Libya. But the choice\\nis between uncertainty and the certainty that if Colonel Qaddafi wins, regimes acrosS the region will\\nconclude that force is the livay to answer protests. And when Colonel Qaddafi massacres the\\nopposition, young protesters across the Middle East will conclude that when we were asked to support\\ntheir cause with more than words, we blinked. Americans in turn will read the words of Mr. Obama\\'s\\nJune 2009 speech in Cairo., with its lofty promises to stand for universal human rights, and cringe.\\nLet\\'s arm the rebels instead. Some commentators who agree with the analysis above say we could\\n\\'better accomplish our goals by providing intelligence and arms to the opposition. That would, of\\ncourse, be much easier for us. It undoubtedly appeals to Mn Obama as a neat compromise between\\nthe desire to help the protesters and the desire not to overrule his defense secretary\\'s reluctance to\\nparticipate in a no-flight zone. But we would be providing arms not to a disciplined military, but to\\nragged groups of brave volunteers who barely know how to use the weapons they have. They need\\naction that will change the situation on. the ground for Colonel Qaddafi, as well as his the calculations.\\nMoreover, by the time arms and intelligence could take effect, it is quite likely that Colonel Qaddafi\\nwill have retaken or at least besieged .Benghazi, the opposition stronghold.\\nThe United States should immediately ask the Security Council to authorize a no-flight zOne and\\nmake clear to Russia and China that if they block the resolution, the blood of the Libyan opposition\\nwill be on their hands. We should push them at least to abstain and bring the issue to a vote as soon as\\npossible. If we get a resolution, we should work with the Arab League to quickly assemble an\\ninternational coalition to impose the no-flight zone. If the Security Council fails toact, then we should\\nrecognize the opposition Interim National Council as the legitimate Libyan government, as France has\\ndone, and work with the Arab League to give the council any assistance it requests:\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739568\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

On September 12, 2012 Libyan President Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf\\ntold senior advisors that the death of the U.S. Ambassador at the hands of Islamist\\nmilitia forces represents a threat to the future of the newly elected General National\\nCongress (GNC) Government. According to a sensitive source, el Magariaf\\nbelieves that the primary goal of this and other attacks on Western facilities is to\\ndemonstrate that the GNC cannot protect its non-Islamic friends. Libyan security\\nofficials believe that the attack was carried out by forces of the Islamist militia\\ngroup calling itself the Ansar al Sharia brigade; working out of camps in the\\nEastern suburbs of Benghazi. These officials added that their sources indicate that\\nthis group is led by former members of the old Libyan Islamic Fighting Group\\n(LIFG), some of whom are loyal to Islamist General Abclelhakim Belhaj. The\\nsame officials were quick to point out that they have no evidence that Belhaj had\\nany direct involvement in this attack. They also have no direct information as to\\nwhether this assault has anything to do with the death of Libyan born al Qai\\'da\\nleader Abu Yahya al- Libi, but they are pursuing this theme.

According to this source, the immediate events were set in motion by a\\nstatement made by a Muslim Cleric in Egypt saying that the interne film was\\ngoing to be shown across the United States on September 11 in an effort to insult\\nMuslims on the anniversary of the attacks on the New York World Trade Center in\\n2001. This statement inspired increasingly hostile demonstrations at the U.S.\\nEmbassy in Cairo, and at diplomatic facilities in Libya. In Benghazi, reporting\\nfrom security sources states, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia\\nfighters left their base in East Benghazi just after sundown infiltrated the crowd of\\nabout 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These forces, operating under\\ncover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire with\\nrocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El\\nMagariaf ordered security officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that\\nhe had been in touch with Egyptian President Mohmmed Morsi, and the two\\nagreed that their intelligence and security personnel will cooperate in this matter.\\n(Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was\\norganized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence\\nof such a complex operation at this time.\\n3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security\\nofficers also informed el Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for\\napproximately one month, based on casing information obtained during an early\\ndemonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi.

These officials add that government security officers\\nadmitted to el Magariaf that they do not have the physical capacity to locate,\\nattack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade, among others. They describe these\\nforces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent time in\\nAfghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and\\nLibyan officials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia\\'s are\\nbetter armed than the forces of the new National Army.\\n4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that\\nthe attacks were planned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion\\nof the Libyan population is focused on past cooperation between Western\\nintelligence and security services, and the regime of former dictator Muammar al\\nQaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.\\nAmbassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to\\ndisarming the militias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi\\nbeliefs, and efforts to discredit his government through linking him to Western\\nintelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security officials to cooperate\\nwith their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared for\\nU.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry\\npublic reaction that is sure to follow.\\n5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added that in\\nprivate conversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a\\nsenior diplomatic official, foreign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up\\nnew operations in Libya. According to this sensitive source, el Magariaf believes\\nthat a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced al Qai\\'da and other\\nradical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739578\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

These groups are receiving aid and weapons from supporters in Sudan.\\nIn the end, el Magariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus\\non this point, he believes the attacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S.\\nand other Western states are aimed first at overthrowing his government, and\\nreplacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist leaders.

This source added that el Magariafs advisors believe that this situation adds\\nto the President\\'s growing concern over the unpredictable effects that will follow\\ncurrent covert efforts by his political opponents to link him directly to foreign\\nintelligence services. According to a separate sensitive source, el Magariaf noted that\\nhis opponents had often tried to connect him to the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency\\n(CIA) through the National Front for the Salvation of Libya (NFSL), a group\\nestablished in opposition to former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, which el Magariaf\\nled in the 1980s. In the opinion of this individual el Magariaf believes that he can\\nsurvive potential negative publicity in this regard, but if this situation continues to\\ndevelop in this manner it will complicate his efforts to establish an orderly\\nadministration in the country. Again, he stated that the attacks on the U.S. missions\\nwere as much a result of the atmosphere created by this campaign, as the controversial\\ninternet video.\\n3. At the same time, this individual noted that several of el Magariafs advisors\\nshare his concerns in this matter, pointing out that the return of Qaddafi\\'s intelligence\\nchief Abdullah al-Seno-ussi for trial in Libya has heightened public interest in the\\nliaison relationships conducted by the CIA and British Secret Intelligence Service (SIS)\\nwith Qaddfi\\'s intelligence and security services. These same individuals note that they\\nbelieve Islamist militia forces under the command of General Abdelhaldm Belhaj\\ncaptured files and documents describing this relationship from Qaddafi\\'s offices in\\nTripoli. This fascination with Western intelligence operations in Qaddafi\\'s Libya is also\\ndriven by Human Rights Watch (HRW) and its efforts to tie Western governments to\\nhuman rights violations committed under Qaddafi. In this regard HRW has\\ninterviewed at least fourteen (14) individuals claiming that they were turned over to\\nQaddafi\\'s forces by the Western powers. Belhaj is included in this group.\\n4. (Source Comment: In the opinion of a very sensitive source, el Magariafs\\nenemies are working to take advantage of his suspected links to the CIA at a time when\\nWestern intelligence services are under scrutiny in Libya. They also fear that this\\nsituation will only grow more complex as Qaddafi\\'s son Saif al Islam Qaddafi and al\\nSenousi are brought before Libyan courts to answer for their crimes under the old\\nregime, particularly during the 2011 revolution.

In Benghazi, reporting from security sources\\nstates, approximately twenty one (21) Ansar al Sharia fighters left their base in East Benghazi just\\nafter sundown infiltrated the crowd of about 2,000 demonstrators at the U.S. Consulate. These\\nforces, operating under cover of darkness, opened fire on the consulate, eventually setting it on fire\\nwith rocket propelled grenades. These fighters then withdrew to their camp. El Magariaf ordered\\nsecurity officials to identify and arrest the attackers, adding that he had been in touch with Egyptian\\nPresident Mohmmed Morsi, and the two agreed that their intelligence and security personnel will\\ncooperate in this matter. (Note: Some of the Libyan officials believe that the entire demonstration was\\norganized as cover for the attack, however; they point out that there is no evidence of such a complex\\noperation at this time.\\n3. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Libyan security officers also informed\\nel Magariaf that the attacks had been planned for approximately one month, based on casing\\ninformation obtained during an early demonstration at the U.S. consulate in Benghazi. The attackers\\nwere, in the opinion of these individuals, looking for an opportunity to approach the consulate under\\ncover in a crowd. These officials add that government security officers admitted to el Magariaf that\\nthey do not have the physical capacity to locate, attack, and destroy the Ansar al-Sharia brigade,\\namong others. They describe these forces as well-trained, hardened killers; many of whom have spent\\ntime in Afghanistan and Yemen. These fighters are located in camps in Eastern Libya; and Libyan\\nofficials doubt they can penetrate these camps because the militia\\'s are better armed than the forces\\nof the new National Army.\\n4. In the opinion of a separate source El Magariaf continues to believe that the attacks were\\nplanned and carried out in a political atmosphere where a portion of the Libyan population is focused\\non past cooperation between Western intelligence and security services, and the regime of former\\ndictator Muammar al Qaddafi. According to this source, el Magariaf realizes that the death of the U.S.\\nAmbassador dictates that he must find tangible solutions to the problems tied to disarming the\\nmilitias, dealing Salafist violence against the followers of Sufi beliefs, and efforts to discredit his\\ngovernment through linking him to Western intelligence services. El Magariaf instructed his security\\nofficials to cooperate with their U.S. counterparts. He also warned all of his advisors to be prepared\\nfor U.S. retaliation against the suspected perpetrators of this attack, and the angry public reaction that\\nis sure to follow.\\n5. (Source Comment: A separate, particularly sensitive source added. that in private\\nconversation el Magariaf stated that if his government cannot protect a senior diplomatic official,\\nforeign businesses will not be willing to risk opening up new operations in Libya. According to this\\nsensitive source, el Magariaf believes that a number of the Islamist militias are now being influenced\\nal Qai\\'da and other radical groups; working out of camps in the Eastern and Southeastern parts of the\\ncountry.

In the end, el\\nMagariaf added that while he does not expect U.S. officials to focus on this point, he believes the\\nattacks against the interests and citizens of the U.S. and other Western states are aimed first at\\noverthrowing his government, and replacing it with a strict Islamic Republic dominated by Salafist\\nleaders.

And the creation of an anti-Islamic video\\n(ironically entitled \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst\\n(or excuse) for the protests.\\nWhy Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed\\nMost Americans operate by a different \"\"we.\"\" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly\\nattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.\\nLibyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, \"\"I\\ncondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free\\npeople everywhere.\"\"\\n\"\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the\\nInternet,\"\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. \"\"The United States deplores any intentional effort to\\ndenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning\\nof our nation.\"\"\\nIn a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as\"\"This Is Water,\"\" novelist David\\nFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the \"\"natural, basic self-centeredness\"\" that puts \"\"me\"\" at the center of\\nthe world.\\nThis unconscious \"\"default setting\"\" fosters the sort of \"\"blind certainty\"\" that manifests as arrogant atheism and\\nfundamentalism alike, Wallace said. And the point of education is to shake us out of that \"\"default setting\"\" ??to\\nbegin to see things from the perspectives of others.\\nFollow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739590\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nWallace focused in his speech on the individual \"\"I.\"\" But his critique can be applied as well to another \"\"default\\nsetting\"\" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of\\nGive:5\\nAccording to those who stormed the embassies, \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\" was not made by an individual\\n(whoever the shadowy \"\"Sam Bacile\"\" may ??or may not ??be). It was made by anAmerican.\\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\\nprotests turned deadly, condemning \"\"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\"\\nCNN\\'s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\" are imprisoned in some\\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world\\'s Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\\nTheir film doesn\\'t just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\\ndupes.\\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\\nas \"\"Sam Bacile\"\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"\"Islam is a cancer.\"\"\\nYou don\\'t need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\\nand you don\\'t need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\\nreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than\\noffending them with an ignorant movie.\\nNonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as \"\"blind certainty.\"\"\\nOur world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and\\nHindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.\\nNeither is it divided into secularists and people of faith ??the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.\\nThe real \"\"red line\"\" in the modem world divides the certain from the uncertain.

And the creation of an anti-Islamic video\\n(ironically entitled \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\") by a producer thought to be an American provided the catalyst\\n(or excuse) for the protests.\\nWhy Muslims are sensitive about portraying the Prophet Mohammed\\nMost Americans operate by a different \"\"we.\"\" From our perspective, the assault was an unjust and cowardly\\nattack on (among other things) the rule of law, the institution of diplomacy and the right of free speech.\\nLibyan Deputy Prime Minister Mustafa Abushagur gave voice to this perspective when he said on Twitter, \"\"I\\ncondemn these barbaric attacks in the strongest possible terms. This is an attack on America, Libya and free\\npeople everywhere.\"\"\\n\"\"Some have sought to justify this vicious behavior as a response to inflammatory material posted on the\\nInternet,\"\" Secretary of State Hillary Clinton added. \"\"The United States deplores any intentional effort to\\ndenigrate the religious beliefs of others. Our commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning\\nof our nation.\"\"\\nIn a commencement speech at Kenyon College in 2005, later published as\"\"This Is Water,\"\" novelist David\\nFoster Wallace urged student to scrutinize the \"\"natural, basic self-centeredness\"\" that puts \"\"me\"\" at the center of\\nthe world.\\nThis unconscious \"\"default setting\"\" fosters the sort of \"\"blind certainty\"\" that manifests as arrogant atheism and\\nfundamentalism alike, Wallace said.

It was made by anAmerican.\\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\\nprotests turned deadly, condemning \"\"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\"\\nCNN\\'s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\" are imprisoned in some\\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world\\'s Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\\nTheir film doesn\\'t just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\\ndupes.\\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\\nas \"\"Sam Bacile\"\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"\"Islam is a cancer.\"\"\\nYou don\\'t need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\\nand you don\\'t need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\\nreligion.

After the fall of dictator Moammar\\nGadhafi last year, the State Department launched a mission to round up thousands of MANPADS that may\\nhave been looted from military installations across the country. U.S. officials previously told ABC\\nNews they were concerned the MANPADS could fall into the hands of terrorists, creating a threat to\\ncommercial airliners.\\nREAD: Nightmare in Libya: Thousands of Surface-to-Air Missiles Unaccounted For\\nDoherty said that he traveled throughout Libya chasing reports of the weapons and once they were found,\\nhis team would destroy them on the spot by bashing them with hammers or repeatedly running them over\\nwith their vehicles.

He spent 10 years as an information management officer\\nin the State Department, he was posted at The Hague, and was in Libya on a brief temporary\\nassignment. He was a husband to his wife Heather, with whom I spoke this morning. He was a\\nfather to two young children, Samantha and Nathan. They will grow up being proud of the\\nservice their father gave to our country, service that took him from Pretoria to Baghdad, and\\nfinally to Benghazi.\\nThe mission that drew Chris and Sean and their colleagues to Libya is both noble and necessary,\\nand we and the people of Libya honor their memory by carrying it forward. This is not easy.\\nToday, many Americans are asking -- indeed, I asked myself how could this happen? How\\ncould this happen in a country we helped liberate, in a city we helped save from destruction?\\nThis question reflects just how complicated and, at times, how confounding the world can be.\\nBut we must be clear-eyed, even in our grief. This was an attack by a small and savage group ??not the people or Government of Libya. Everywhere Chris and his team went in Libya, in a\\ncountry scarred by war and tyranny, they were hailed as friends and partners. And when the\\nattack came yesterday, Libyans stood and fought to defend our post. Some were wounded.\\nLibyans carried Chris\\' body to the hospital, and they helped rescue and lead other Americans to\\nsafety. And last night, when I spoke with the President of Libya, he strongly condemned the\\nviolence and pledged every effort to protect our people and pursue those responsible.\\nThe friendship between our countries, borne out of shared struggle, will not be another casualty\\nof this attack. A free and stable Libya is still in America\\'s interest and security, and we will not\\nturn our back on that, nor will we rest until those responsible for these attacks are found and\\nbrought to justice. We are working closely with the Libyan authorities to move swiftly and\\nsurely. We are also working with partners around the world to safeguard other American\\nembassies, consulates, and citizens.\\nThere will be more time later to reflect, but today, we have work to do. There is no higher\\npriority than protecting our men and women wherever they serve. We are working to determine\\nthe precise motivations and methods of those who carried out this assault. Some have sought to\\njustify this vicious behavior, along with the protest that took place at our Embassy in Cairo\\nyesterday, as a response to inflammatory material posted on the intemet. America\\'s commitment\\nto religious tolerance goes back to the very beginning of our nation. But let me be clear ??there is\\nno justification for this, none. Violence like this is no way to honor religion or faith. And as long\\nas there are those who would take innocent life in the name of God, the world will never know a\\ntrue and lasting peace.\\nIt is especially difficult that this happened on September 1 1th It\\'s an anniversary that means a\\ngreat deal to all Americans.

Doherty in Benghazi, Libya\\nSeptember 13, 2012\\nThe attack on our diplomatic post in Benghazi, Libya on Tuesday claimed the lives of four\\nAmericans. Yesterday, I spoke about two: Ambassador Chris Stevens and Information\\nManagement Officer Sean Smith. Today, we also recognize the two security personnel who died\\nhelping protect their colleagues. Tyrone S. Woods and Glen A. Doherty were both decorated\\nmilitary veterans who served our country with honor and distinction. Our thoughts, prayers, and\\ndeepest gratitude are with their families and friends. Our embassies could not carry on our\\ncritical work around the world without the service and sacrifice of brave people like Tyrone and\\nGlen.\\nTyrone\\'s friends and colleagues called him \"\"Rone,\"\" and they relied on his courage and skill,\\nhoned over two decades as a Navy SEAL. In uniform, he served multiple tours in Iraq and\\nAfghanistan. Since 2010, he protected American diplomatic personnel in dangerous posts from\\nCentral America to the Middle East. He had the hands of a healer as well as the arm of a warrior,\\nearning distinction as a registered nurse and certified paramedic. All our hearts go out to\\nTyrone\\'s wife Dorothy and his three sons, Tyrone Jr., Hunter, and Kai, who was born just a few\\nmonths ago.\\nWe also grieve for Glen Doherty, called Bub, and his family: his father Bernard, his mother\\nBarbara, his brother Gregory, and his sister Kathleen. Glen was also a former Navy SEAL and an\\nexperienced paramedic. And he put his life on the line many times, protecting Americans in Iraq,\\nAfghanistan, and other hotspots. In the end, he died the way he lived ??with selfless honor and\\nunstinting valor.\\nWe condemn the attack that took the lives of these heroes in the strongest terms, and we are\\ntaking additional steps to safeguard American embassies, consulates, and citizens around the\\nworld.

Well, let me welcome our friends and colleagues\\nfrom Morocco here to the Benjamin Franklin Room on the eighth floor of the State Department\\nfor this very important first session of the U.S.-Morocco Strategic Dialogue. Before I begin to\\naddress the significance of this Strategic Dialogue and the next step in our long relations with\\nMorocco, I want to say a few words about the events unfolding in the world today.\\nWe are closely watching what is happening in Yemen and elsewhere, and we certainly hope and\\nexpect that there will be steps taken to avoid violence and prevent the escalation of protests into\\nviolence.\\nI also want to take a moment to address the video circulating on the Internet that has led to these\\nprotests in a number of countries. Let me state very clearly and I hope it is obvious -- that the\\nUnited States Government had absolutely nothing to do with this video. We absolutely reject its\\ncontent and message. America\\'s commitment to religious tolerance goes back to the very\\nbeginning of our nation. And as you know, we are home to people of all religions, many of\\nwhom came to this country seeking the right to exercise their own religion, including, of course,\\nmillions of Muslims. And we have the greatest respect for people of faith.\\nTo us, to me personally, this video is disgusting and reprehensible. It appears to have a deeply\\ncynical purpose: to denigrate a great religion and to provoke rage. But as I said yesterday, there\\nis no justification, none at all, for responding to this video with violence. We condemn the\\nviolence that has resulted in the strongest terms, and we greatly appreciate that many Muslims in\\nthe United States and around the world have spoken out on this issue.\\nViolence, we believe, has no place in religion and is no way to honor religion. Islam, like other\\nreligions, respects the fundamental dignity of human beings, and it is a violation of that\\nfundamental dignity to wage attacks on innocents. As long as there are those who are willing to\\nshed blood and take innocent life in the name of religion, the name of God, the world will never\\nknow a true and lasting peace. It is especially wrong for violence to be directed against\\ndiplomatic missions, These are places whose very purpose is peaceful: to promote better\\nunderstanding across countries and cultures. All governments have a responsibility to protect\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739610\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Now, I would\\nnote that in today\\'s world with today\\'s technologies, that is impossible. But even if it were\\npossible, our country does have a long tradition of free expression which is enshrined in our\\nConstitution and our law, and we do not stop individual citizens from expressing their views no\\nmatter how distasteful they may be.\\nThere are, of course, different views around the world about the outer limits of free speech and\\nfree expression, but there should be no debate about the simple proposition that violence in\\nresponse to speech is not acceptable. We all ??whether we are leaders in government, leaders in\\ncivil society or religious leaders ??must draw the line at violence. And any responsible leader\\nshould be standing up now and drawing that line.\\nI wanted to begin with this statement, because, as our Moroccan friends and all of you know, this\\nhas been a difficult week at the State Department. I very much appreciate, Minister, the\\ncondolences your government expressed to our Embassy in Rabat. And even though that tragedy\\nhappened far away in Benghazi, we found a reminder of the deep bounds that connect Morocco\\nto the United States. It was in the High Atlas Mountains of Morocco that one of the Americans\\nwe lost this week, Ambassador Chris Stevens, fell in love with the region when he served as a\\nPeace Corps volunteer there. That experience set him on a decades-long career of service. So in\\nthe memory of fallen friends and colleagues, let us remind ourselves of the many ways in which\\nnot just our governments but the people of our two nations have worked together to build a better\\nfuture.\\nIn many ways, the United States looks to Morocco to be a leader and a model. His Majesty King\\nMohammed deserves great credit for the work you\\'ve undertaken. In fact, after my visit to Rabat\\nearlier this year, I told my team: \"\"We need to start a Strategic Dialogue with Morocco.\"\" No\\ncountry has been a friend of the United States longer than Morocco. You were the first nation to\\nrecognize us back in 1777. But we\\'re not satisfied with simply having a friendship that is\\nlongstanding. We want one that is dynamic, growing, looking toward the future. So let me\\nhighlight a few of the areas we should focus on today.\\nOn political reform, we have all seen remarkable changes taking place across North Africa and\\nthe Middle East. I commend Morocco and your government for your efforts to stay ahead of\\nthese changes by holding free and fair elections, empowering the elected parliament, taking other\\nsteps to ensure that the government reflects the will of the people. Today, our political working\\ngroup will discuss how the United States can continue to support your efforts to translate\\ncommitments into actions. Because as we all know, democracy, real reform, require that people\\nthemselves feel the changes in their everyday lives: the courts reformed, the goverment more\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739610\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

We know that child brides are less likely to get an education, more likely to face\\nlife-threatening problems, particularly around child birth and delivery, which not only\\nshortchanges them but can even rob them and their communities of their lives and talents. So we\\nwant to encourage the government and civil society to continue their important work together on\\nthis issue.\\nWith regard to the Western Sahara, the United States continues to support efforts to find a\\npeaceful, sustainable, mutually agreed-upon solution. U.S. policy toward the Western Sahara has\\nremained consistent for many years. We have made clear that Morocco\\'s autonomy plan is\\nserious, realistic, and credible, and that it represents a potential approach that could satisfy the\\naspirations of the people in the Western Sahara to run their own affairs in peace and dignity. We\\ncontinue to support the negotiations carried out by the United Nations and hope parties can work\\ntoward resolution.\\nWith respect to the economy, our second working group will focus on what more can be done to\\ndeliver tangible economic benefits. Morocco\\'s economy is relatively healthy, but you face the\\nsame problem that is now endemic across the world ??unemployment is still too high, especially\\namong young people.\\nThat\\'s why the United States is providing $1.5 million to support an effart to attract foreign\\ninvestors, foster local economic development, and combat corruption across the region. And I\\'m\\npleased to announce that later this year we will hold a Morocco business development\\nconference here in Washington to connect businesses from both countries.\\n\\'Today, we should discuss ways to build on all of these efforts by increasing bilateral trade, a\\nparticular goal of mine since so much trade from Morocco goes to Europe. I\\'d like to increase\\nthe amount of trade coming to the United States, and also to improve economic integration\\nacross North Africa, which could greatly benefit Morocco because of Morocco\\'s stability and\\nMorocco\\'s very strong economic foundation. The greater integration there is, the greater the\\nbenefits for Moroccans.\\nThird, the attack in Benghazi this week reminds us that security remains a vital issue. Through\\nour work together on the Global Counterterrorism Task Force, the United States and Morocco\\nalready share crucial information and best practices, and I thank Morocco for hosting a Global\\nCounterterrorism Task Force workshop on threats in the South Atlantic next month.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739610\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

But among all our work on this front from\\npreserving Morocco\\'s historic sites to empowering youth, there\\'s one area I particularly hope we\\ncan focus on today and receive your advice and counsel ??munely, interfaith dialogue.\\nIn these tense and turbulent times, its more important than ever for people of different faiths to\\nexchange ideas, to build understanding, to promote religious tolerance. It\\'s one of the great\\nchallenges of the 21 century, and it\\'s one that we must address together.\\nSo we have a lot of work to do, Minister, but our friendship runs long and deep, and as the treaty\\nour nations signed in 1786 says. and I quote, \"\"Trusting in God, it will remain permanent.\"\" I\\'m\\nconfident that we will continue to solve problems and produce results that make our nations\\nstronger more peaceful, more secure, more prosperous, and also contribute to doing the same Rif\\nthe world.\\nSo again, let me welcome you, Minister.

And we condemn the violence in the strongest terms, the violence against our posts in\\nBenghazi, in Egypt, and now in Yemen.\\nThe Libyan ambassador is with us tonight, and I want to take a moment to thank him for the\\nsupport that his government and the Libyan people have shown to the United States in this\\ntragedy, particularly the outpouring of feelings of grief and loss because of the killing of our\\nambassador.\\nAmbassador Aujali, would you mind saying a few words?\\nAMBASSADOR AUJALI: [redacted}\\nSECRETARY CLINTON: Thank you very much, Ambassador. I know that that was a very\\npersonal loss for you, as it was for me. I\\'m the one who sent Chris to Benghazi during the\\nrevolution to show support and be able to advise our government about what we could do to\\nbring freedom and democracy and opportunity to the people of Libya.\\nReligious freedom and religious tolerance are essential to the stability of any nation, any people.\\nHatred and violence in the name of religion only poison the well. All people of faith and good\\nwill know that the actions of a small and savage group in Benghazi do not honor religion or God\\nin any way. Nor do they speak for the more than one billion Muslims around the world, many of\\nwhom have shown an outpouring of support during this time.\\nUnfortunately, however, over the last 24 hours, we have also seen violence spread elsewhere.\\nSome seek to justify this behavior as a response to inflammatory, despicable material posted on\\nthe internet. As I said earlier today, the United States rejects both the content and the message of\\nthat video. The United States deplores any intentional effort to denigrate the religious beliefs of\\nothers. At our meeting earlier today, my colleague, the foreign minister of Morocco, said that all\\nprophets should be respected because they are all symbols of our humanity, for all humanity,\\nBut both of us were crystal clear in this paramount message: There is never any justification for\\nviolent acts of this kind. And we look to leaders around the world to stand up and speak out\\nagainst violence, and to take steps to protect diplomatic missions from attack.\\nThink about it. When Christians are subject to insults to their faith, and that certainly happens,\\nwe expect them not to resort to violence. When Hindus or Buddhists are subjected to insults to\\ntheir faiths and that also certainly happens, we expect them not to resort to violence. The same\\ngoes for all faiths, including Islam.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739610\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nWhen all of us who are people of faith ??and I am one ??feel the pain of insults, of\\nmisunderstanding, of denigration to what we cherish, we must expect ourselves and others not to\\nresort to violence. That is a universal standard and expectation, and it is everyone\\'s obligation to\\nmeet that, so that we make no differences, we expect no less of ourselves than we expect of\\nothers. You cannot respond to offensive speech with violence without begetting more violence.\\nAnd I so strongly believe that the great religions of the world are stronger than any insults. They\\nhave withstood offense for centuries. Refraining from violence, then, is not a sign of weakness in\\none\\'s faith; it is absolutely the opposite, a sign that one\\'s faith is unshakable.\\nSo tonight, we must come together and recommit ourselves to working toward a future marked\\nby understanding and acceptance rather than distrust, hatred, and fear. We can pledge that\\nwhenever one person speaks out in ignorance and bigotry, ten voices will answer. They will\\nanswer resoundingly against the offense and the insult, answering ignorance with enlightenment,\\nanswering hatred with understanding, answering darkness with light; that if one person commits\\na violent act in the name of religion, millions will stand up and condemn it out of strength.\\nIn times like these, it can be easy to despair that some differences are irreconcilable, some\\nmountains too steep to climb; we will therefore never reach the level of understanding and\\npeacefulness that we seek, and which I believe the great religions o\"\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n the world call us to pursue.\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\nBut that\\'s not what I believe\\t and I don\\'t think it\\'s what you believe either here tonight.

I thought of my own journey\\nthat day down flights of stairs in the building next door to the embassy, after having been knocked out by the blast, of\\nthe people who risked their lives to save others and of how we carried on under horrendous circumstances\\nNow every time I pass the black marble wall, I will think of Ambassador a Christopher Stevens and his colleagues who\\ndied after an attack on our consulate in Benghazi, Libya, this week,\\nDiplomats don\\'t often make headlines until something horrible happens. Even then, it is policy and politics that get the\\nattention. We had barely learned of the attack before talking heads began to expound on Middle East policies and the\\nwords administration officials used or should have used, to uphold our national dignity. Where were the conversations\\nabout the diplomats who were actually carrying out those policies in faraway, often dangerous places, the people who\\ntake care of us despite the hardship and risk? Imagine what it must have been like trying to escape the raging fire in the\\nBenghazi consulate or enduring hours of assault in the nearby annex waiting for relief from the Libyan government.\\nDiplomacy is a dangerous profession. You cannot exert influence by whispering in diplomatic code to your government\\ncounterparts behind closed doors. You do not spread American values - especially in places where passions are high,\\ngovernments fragile and guns plentiful - by remote control from Washington. You have to get out from behind the walls\\nand engage with people. We know this can put us in harm\\'s way; our people in the Benghazi consulate knew it. And they\\ndid their jobs anyway.\\nThat is because, hokey as it sounds, the people who represent us overseas really do believe they can make a difference.\\nThey confront violent behavior and strong passions with American leadership, smart power and peaceful means.\\nWe must make that work safer. The reasons for violence change with time and place but the human effects are the\\nsame. For two years before we were blown up in Nairobi, Kenya, my team and I fought (\"\"nagged\"\" was the word State\\nDepartment colleagues used) to have security threats and vulnerabilities addressed. We were too close to the street, an\\neasy target. Washington\\'s assessment was that things were 0.1e, Anyway, I was told, there was no money for a more\\nsecure embassy. What was Washington\\'s assessment of our consulate in Benghazi? We may not like the image of\\nAmerican diplomats working out of fortified boxes, but we cannot let them work in buildings that can be overrun by\\nattackers. This is a lesson our government still hasn\\'t learned since 1979 in Tehran,\\nIf the Benghazi tragedy traces the same journey we made from the rubble in Nairobi, heartfelt pronouncements will be\\nmade; the dead will be given due homage and then they will be buried. The press will alight on other stories.

Easy fixes changes to emergency action plans, minor security upgrades - will be\\nmade; expensive and hard ones will not.\\nThe Foreign Service is short on people, and those people are rushed into the field short on training. We build concrete\\nfortresses when we have to, but we don\\'t invest in the mobile communications and security technology that would\\nprotect diplomats when they leave the embassy, as they must. What kinds of technology, systems, training and\\ndeployment do we need to get results through diplomacy in the 21st century? These are the difficult questions that will\\nremain unanswered, while diplomats disappear from public view once again. Until the next time someone dies - then we\\nsee the same sorry response all over again.\\nBut we can give meaning to this tragedy. What if President Obama and Mitt Romney exercised true leadership by\\nexplaining to Americans, including the families and friends of those who died in Benghazi, what diplomacy is all about?\\nWhy using words and deeds for peace is as important as using weapons. Why we value our diplomats and what we will\\ndo to make their jobs easier, if we cannot guarantee their absolute security.\\nIt is a stretch, I know. Far easier to add some more concrete, declare our responsibilities to diplomats complete and\\nmove back to the fun stuff of making and debating policy, most of it domestic. The black wall will continue to\\naccumulate names, diplomats will continue to represent our country on the cheap and nothing much will change. Like\\nthat scenario? If not, start demanding leadership. That is what Chris Stevens and his team were providing.

He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\\noperation.\\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\\nSeptember 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obama\\'s reaction to what happened in Libya\\n\"\"inexplicable\"\" and added that Obama is \"\"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief.\"\" He went on to warn that Obama\\'s policies in Libya\\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \"\"I am astonished,\"\" Rove said. \"\"We are projecting weakness\\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\"\\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"\"This\\nis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the\\nmost transparent in history,\"\" he told Fox News. \"\"And it\\'s the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of\\ncover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\\nAmericans.\"\"\\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"\"I think it\\'s because they have this\\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\"\" he said. \"\"They never say the words \\'Islamic fundamentalist\\nterrorism\\'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia ??he was going to declare\\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\\nconvenient narrative.\"\"\\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration\\'s response to\\n\"\"the terrorist attack\"\" in Libya as And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"\"I think they want to do their very best to\\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\"\" Romney said.\\nAdded Ryan, \"\"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We\\'ll leave it up to you to decide whether it\\'s a cover-up or not.\"\"\\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico artkle posted last night said Romney advisers were\\ndivided over hovv aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"\"a huge gift\"\" to the campaign. \"\"Across the board ??domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues ??President Obama has been outmatched by events,\"\" he\\nsaid. \"\"He\\'s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he\\'s been outmatched.\"\"\\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\\nthe central issue. \"\"They\\'ll tell you that you\\'ve got to focus people on the fact that their economic\\nprospects are not very good and all that,\"\" the aide told Politico. \"\"Well, Romney\\'s been trying to do that\\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April ??and he\\'s failed. The president is better at\\ndeflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on\\nindividual voters.\"\"\\nCraig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \"\"House of Bush, House of Saud,\"\" and a\\nfrequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC\\'s Today Show and\\nother broadcast outlets.

Late in the day on September 14, 2012, Egyptian President Mohamad Morsi told senior\\nEuropean diplomats that he is increasingly concerned the current anti-U.S. and anti-Western violence\\nspreading through Cairo and into the rest of Egypt may be part of an effort by his Salafist political\\nrivals to destabilize his government, which many of them believe is too moderate in its positions\\nregarding Islam, Israel, and the non-Muslim world. According to this source, Morsi, who is in\\nBrussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly concerned over a message from\\nArmy commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist guerrillas, believed to be drawn\\nprimarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an attack on a base of the International\\nPeacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General reported that the 1500 United Nations troops at\\nthe base, including some U.S. forces, were under heavy attack and casualty figures were not yet\\nknown. Morsi stated that this fight was an example of radical anti-government forces and Salafist\\nIslamist dissidents taking advantage of the current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his\\ngovernment is unable to protect Western personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the\\nsuccess or failure of his regime is directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that\\ncan work with western business interests.\\n2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is related\\nto an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What makes it more\\nfrustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by members of the Salafist al\\nNour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi\\'s Freedom and Justice Party (RIP) in the new Egyptian\\nParliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning the initial attacks on the U.S.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739624\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Late on the evening of September 13, 2012, Mohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of\\nthe Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a message to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme\\nGuidance Council were concerned that the situation around the U.S. Embassy was getting out of\\ncontrol and that, difficult as it might seem, he had to take tough measures against the demonstrators,\\nand protect the interests of the U.S. and other Western Governments. In a telephone discussion with\\nSaad al-Katany, the MB/Freedom and Justice Party (MB/KIP) Speaker of the lower house of\\nparliament, Morsi admitted that he had felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor\\npersonal relations with the leaders of al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)\\n3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely forceful\\nmessages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President, leaving no doubt\\nin his mind that the U.S. ?봂gyptian relations and more than $1billion in U.S. aid were at stake in this\\nmatter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian Army, he and al-Katany agreed\\nthat actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new Egyptian administration\\'s current\\ngood relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi instructed the military and security forces to use\\nall necessary force short of lethal measures to protect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private\\nconversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is losing control of the political situation and fears that if the\\ncurrent fighting results in deaths, either of demonstrators, U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security\\npersonnel, or UN peacekeepers, the situation may spin out of control and his government could fall.\\nAl-Katany agreed, but said that taking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the\\nsituation calms down they will have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future,\\ntake advantage of circumstances to try to destabilize Morsi\\'s administration. With this in mind, Morsi\\nordered al-Sissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to\\nstep up operations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership, focusing on any\\ncontacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.\\n4. (Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is warning\\nMorsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the heart of this\\nsituation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report gains wider\\ncirculation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by Islamists against that\\ncommunity, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)\\n5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his troops\\ntake harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and facilities. The\\nGeneral is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than Morsi realizes, and\\nhe has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these individuals. In\\naddition, he stated in private that Morsi and al-Katany spoke with Libyan President Mohammed\\nYussef el Ma.gariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security officials in Egypt and Libya will\\ncooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in Cairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered\\nSpecial Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-Libya border region, while the MI will monitor\\ncommunications between dissidents; primarily Salafists, in both countries. According to this source\\nthe General is convinced that these dissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current\\nunrest to move against the governments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from\\nMorsi to step up cooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this\\nsituation and al-Sissi believes al-Magariaf has given similar instructions to Libyan military and\\nsecurity officials.\\n6. (Source Comment: According to a separate sensitive source, al-Sissi believes that, given his\\nnew orders from Mori, the Army can, for the most part, protect Western facilities and personnel in\\nEgypt. But the General is concerned that the security services can never completely eliminate the\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739624\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

According to this\\nsource, Morsi, who is in Brussels for meetings with the European Union (EU), was particularly\\nconcerned over a message from Army commander General Abdel Fatah al-Sissi, that Islamist\\nguerrillas, believed to be drawn primarily from the Sawarki Bedouin tribe, had launched an\\nattack on a base of the International Peacekeeping Force (IPF) in the Sinai. The General\\nreported that the 1500 United Nations troops at the base, including some U.S. forces, were under\\nheavy attack and casualty figures were not yet known. Morsi stated that this fight was an\\nexample of radical anti-government forces and Salafist Islamist dissidents taking advantage of\\nthe current situation to carry out attacks that demonstrate his government is unable to protect\\nWestern personnel and facilities in Egypt. Morsi stated that the success or failure of his regime\\nis directly tied to his ability to establish a moderate Islamic state that can work with western\\nbusiness interests.\\n2. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, the current wave of violence is\\nrelated to an ongoing struggle between Salafist and Sufi Muslims throughout Egypt. What\\nmakes it more frustrating for Morsi is that much of the violence appears to be inspired by\\nmembers of the Salafist al Nour Party, the coalition partner of Morsi\\'s Freedom and Justice Party\\n(FJP) in the new Egyptian Parliament. According to this individual, Morsi delayed condemning\\nthe initial attacks on the U.S. Embassy out of concern that his opponents would use such a\\nstatement to move against his government. Late on the evening of September 13, 2012,\\nMohammed Badie, the Supreme Guide of the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood (MB), sent a\\nmessage to Morsi warning that he and the Supreme Guidance Council were concerned that the\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739624\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

In a telephone discussion with Saad al-Katany, the MB/Freedom\\nand Justice Party (MB/FJP) Speaker of the lower house of parliament, Morsi admitted that he\\nhad felt constrained from acting, given his past history of poor personal relations with the leaders\\nof al Nour. Al-Katany urged him to gain control of the situation.)\\n3. On September 14, Morsi also stated to an EU official that he had received extremely\\nforceful messages from both the U.S. State Department and the Office of the U.S. President,\\nleaving no doubt in his mind that the U.S. -Egyptian relations and more than $1billion in U.S.\\naid were at stake in this matter. Morsi added that since much of this aid goes to the Egyptian\\nArmy, he and al-Katany agreed that actions that put it in jeopardy would also damage the new\\nEgyptian administration\\'s current good relationship with the Army. Accordingly, Morsi\\ninstructed the military and security forces to use all necessary force short of lethal measures to\\nprotect U.S. and Western facilities. In a private conversation, Morsi stated that he felt he is\\nlosing control of the political situation and fears that if the current fighting results in deaths,\\neither of demonstrators. U.S. diplomats, Egyptian security personnel, or UN peacekeepers, the\\nsituation may spin out of control and his government could fall. Al-Katany agreed, but said that\\ntaking no action would guarantee disaster. They agreed that when the situation calms down they\\nwill have to deal with the al Nour party, which they fear will, in the future, take advantage of\\ncircumstances to try to destabilize Morsi\\'s administration. With this in mind, Morsi ordered al-\\nSissi to direct the commanders of Military Intelligence (MI -Mukhabarat el-Khabeya) to step up\\noperations collecting information on the activities of the al Nour leadership focusing on any\\ncontacts with potentially violent Salafist dissidents.\\n4.(Source Comment: A separate sensitive source also noted that General al-Sissi is\\nwarning Morsi about press reports that the person who made the controversial internet film at the\\nheart of this situation is an Egyptian Coptic Christian. The General cautioned that as this report\\ngains wider circulation, the government and the Army must prepare for violent attacks by\\nIslamists against that community, which makes up ten (10) percent of the Egyptian population.)\\n5. A separate sensitive source noted that for his part, al-Sissi is prepared to to have his\\ntroops take harsh measures against any demonstrators who attack Western personnel and\\nfacilities The General is also concerned that the al Nour leaders are even more dangerous than\\nMorsi realizes, and he has ordered the MI to increase technical and physical surveillance of these\\nindividuals. In addition, he stated in private that Mani and al-Katany spoke with Libyan\\nPresident Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, and they had all agreed that military and security\\nofficials in Egypt and Libya will cooperate in an effort to track links between the violence in\\nCairo and Benghazi. Al-Sissi has ordered Special Forces units to step up patrols in the Egypt-\\nLibya border region, while the MI will monitor communications between dissidents; primarily\\nSalafists, in both countries. According to this source the General is convinced that these\\ndissidents are seizing the opportunity presented by the current unrest to move against the\\ngovernments of Morsi and al-Magariaf. He also received permission from Morsi to step up\\ncooperation with his counterparts in the U.S. and Western Europe to deal with this situation and\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739624\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nD\\nBy Craig UngeIU\\n(Credit: AP/AI BehrmaniSalon)\\nAccording to a highly reliable source, as Mitt Romney and President Barack Obama prepare for the\\nfirst presidential debate Wednesday night, top Republican operatives are primed to unleash a new\\ntwo-pronged offensive that will attack Obama as weak on national security, and will be based, in part\\non new intelligence information regarding the attacks in Libya that killed U.S. ambassador Chris\\nStevens on September it.\\nThe source, who has first-hand knowledge of private, high-level conversations in the Romney camp\\nthat took place in Washington, DC last week, said that at various times the GOP strategists referred to\\ntheir new operation as the Jimmy Carter Strategy or the October Surprise.\\nHe added that they planned to release what they hoped would be \"\"a bombshell\"\" that would make\\nLibya and Obamta\\'s foreign policy a major issue in the campaign. \"\"My understanding is that they have\\ncome up with evidence that the Obama administration had positive intelligence that there was going\\nto be a terrorist attack on the intelligence.\"\"\\nThe source described the Republicans as chortling with glee that the Obama administration\\n\"\"definitely had inter about the attack before it happened. \"\"Intelligence can be graded in different\\nways,\"\" he added, \\'and sometimes A and B don\\'t get connected. But [the Romney campaign] will try to\\npaint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\"\"\\nHe said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a\\nhelpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter\\'s failed\\nattempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. \"\"They are so excited about it,\"\" he said \"\"Over\\nand over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter\\'s failed raid. They feel it is\\ngoing to give them a last-minute landslide in the election.\"\"\\nThe source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. \"\"To me, it is indicative that they have lost\\ntouch with a huge portion of the electorate,\"\" he said.\\nThe source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present But he said, \"\"These\\nwere the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation.\"\" He further\\ndescribed participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican\\nsuper PACs and people who had access to high-level national security. intelligence.\\n\"\"As usual, Karl Rove wasn\\'t present,\"\" he said, \"\"but some were close to Rove.\"\"\\nThe source said that \"\"there was quite a bit more\"\" to the operation than simply revealing the\\nintelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\\noperation.\\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\\nSeptember 26, on Fox News, Karl Rove called Obarna\\'s reaction to what happened in Libya\\n\"\"inexplicable\"\" and added that Obama is \"\"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief.\"\" He went on to warn that Obama\\'s policies in Libya\\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran, \"\"I am astonished,\"\" Rove said \"\"We are projecting weakness\\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\"\\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"\"This\\nis a deliberate attempt to cover up the truth, from an administration that claimed it wanted to be the\\nmost transparent in history,\"\" he told Fox News. \"\"And it\\'s the worst kind of cover-up: the kind of\\ncover-up that involves our national security. This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\\nAmericans.\"\"\\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"\"1 think it\\'s because they have this\\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\"\" he said \"\"They never say the words \\'Islamic fundamentalist\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739627\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The president was moving on to Asia - he was going to declare\\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\\nconvenient narrative.\"\"\\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration\\'s response to\\n\"\"the terrorist attack\"\" in Libya as \"\"bizarre.\"\" And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"\"I think they want to do their very best to\\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\"\" Romney said.\\nAdded Ryan, \"\"Why is he (Mama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We\\'ll leave it up to you to decide whether it\\'s a cover-up or not\"\"\\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were\\ndivided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"\"a huge gift\"\" to the campaign. \"\"Across the board -\\ndomestic, economic and foreign-policy issues - President Mama has been outmatched by events,\"\" he\\nsaid. \"\"He\\'s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he\\'s been outmatched.\"\"\\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\\nthe central issue. \"\"They\\'ll tell you that you\\'ve got to focus people on the fact that their economic\\nprospects are not very good and all that,\"\" the aide told Politico. \"\"Well, Romney\\'s been trying to do that\\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April ??and he\\'s failed.

Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I\\'m biased.\\nMitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East\\nRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.\\nDisturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim\\nBrotherhood has come to power, and the country\\'s peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.\\nembassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all\\nthe while promising to annihilate Israel.\\nThese developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"\"bumps in the road.\"\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.\\nYet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We\\'re not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\\nour allies.\\nAnd that\\'s dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel\\'s security is compromised, America could be\\npulled into the maelstrom.\\nWe still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\\nThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We\\'re unique in having earned that role not\\nthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\\ntrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\\nBut in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"\"recovery\"\" that barely deserves the name. Our national\\ndebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\\nFinally, our values have been misapplied?봞nd misunderstood?봟y a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\\nBy failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\\nHe does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\\nThe Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\\ngrave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\\nweeks\\nThe same incomprehension afflicts the president\\'s policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"\"daylight\"\" between our two\\ncountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"\"closest ally\"\" in the Middle East to being only \"\"one of our closest allies.\"\" It\\'s a diplomatic message that will\\nbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel\\'s concerns about Iran as mere \"\"noise\"\" that he prefers to \"\"block out.\"\" And at a time when\\nIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\nIn this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East?봳hat is, both governments and individuals who\\nshare our values.\\nThis means restoring our credibility with Iran.

Sid\\nThis is it. Pretty uncompelling piece if you ask me, but of course I\\'m biased.\\nMitt Romney: A New Course for the Middle East\\nRestore the three sinews of American influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength of our values.\\nDisturbing developments are sweeping across the greater Middle East. In Syria, tens of thousands of innocent people have been slaughtered. In Egypt, the Muslim\\nBrotherhood has come to power, and the country\\'s peace treaty with Israel hangs In the balance. In Libya, our ambassador was murdered In a terrorist attack. U.S.\\nembassies throughout the region have been stormed in violent protests. And in Iran, the ayatollahs continue to move full tilt toward nuclear-weapons capability, all\\nthe while promising to annihilate Israel.\\nThese developments are not, as President Obama says, mere \"\"bumps in the road.\"\" They are major issues that put our security at risk.\\nYet amid this upheaval, our country seems to be at the mercy of events rather than shaping them. We\\'re not moving them in a direction that protects our people or\\nour allies.\\nAnd that\\'s dangerous. If the Middle East descends into chaos, if Iran moves toward nuclear breakout, or if Israel\\'s security is compromised, America could be\\npulled into the maelstrom.\\nWe still have time to address these threats, but it will require a new strategy toward the Middle East\\nThe first step is to understand how we got here. Since World War II, America has been the leader of the Free World. We\\'re unique in having earned that role not\\nthrough conquest but through promoting human rights, free markets and the rule of law. We ally ourselves with like-minded countries, expand prosperity through\\ntrade and keep the peace by maintaining a military second to none.\\nBut in recent years, President Obama has allowed our leadership to atrophy. Our economy is stuck in a \"\"recovery\"\" that barely deserves the name. Our national\\ndebt has risen to record levels. Our military, tested by a decade of war, is facing devastating cuts thanks to the budgetary games played by the White House.\\nFinally, our values have been misapplied?봞nd misunderstood?봟y a president who thinks that weakness will win favor with our adversaries.\\nBy failing to maintain the elements of our influence and by stepping away from our allies, President Obama has heightened the prospect of conflict and instability.\\nHe does not understand that an American policy that lacks resolve can provoke aggression and encourage disorder.\\nThe Middle East is a case in point. The Arab Spring presented an opportunity to help move millions of people from oppression to freedom. But it also presented\\ngrave risks. We needed a strategy for success, but the president offered none. And now he seeks to downplay the significance of the calamities of the past few\\nweeks\\nThe same incomprehension afflicts the president\\'s policy toward Israel. The president began his term with the explicit policy of creating \"\"daylight\"\" between our two\\ncountries. He recently downgraded Israel from being our \"\"closest ally\"\" in the Middle East to being only \"\"one of our closest allies.\"\" It\\'s a diplomatic message that will\\nbe received clearly by Israel and its adversaries alike. He dismissed Israel\\'s concerns about Iran as mere \"\"noise\"\" that he prefers to \"\"block out.\"\" And at a time when\\nIsrael needs America to stand with it, he declined to meet with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\\nIn this period of uncertainty, we need to apply a coherent strategy of supporting our partners in the Middle East?봳hat is, both governments and individuals who\\nshare our values.\\nThis means restoring our credibility with Iran. When we say an Iranian nuclear-weapons capability?봞nd the regional instability that comes with it--is unacceptable,\\nthe ayatollahs must be made to believe us.\\nIt means placing no daylight between the United States and Israel, And it means using the full spectrum of our soft power to encourage liberty and opportunity for\\nthose who have for too long known only corruption and oppression. The dignity of work and the ability to steer the course of their lives are the best alternatives to\\nextremism.\\nBut this Middle East policy will be undermined unless we restore the three sinews of our influence: our economic strength, our military strength and the strength Of\\nour values.

But [the Romney campaign] will try to\\npaint it to look like Obama had advance knowledge of the attack and is weak on terrorism.\"\"\\nHe said they were jubilant about their new strategy and said they intended to portray Obama as a\\nhelpless, Jimmy Carter-like president and to equate the tragedy in Libya with President Carter\\'s failed\\nattempt to rescue American hostages in Iran in 1980. \"\"They are so excited about it,\"\" he said \"\"Over\\nand over again they talked about how it would be just like Jimmy Carter\\'s failed raid. They feel it is\\ngoing to give them a last-minute landslide in the election.\"\"\\nThe source, however, said he was dubious about the tactic. \"\"To me, it is indicative that they have lost\\ntouch with a huge portion of the electorate,\"\" he said\\nThe source declined to reveal the names of the GOP operatives who were present But he said, \"\"These\\nwere the top guys in the party. It was a private, unguarded planning conversation.\"\" He further\\ndescribed participants in the meeting as consisting of well-known names tied to the big Republican\\nsuper PACs and people who had access to high-level national security intelligence.\\n\"\"As usual, Karl Rove wasn\\'t present,\"\" he said, \"\"but some were close to Rove.\"\"\\nThe source said that \"\"there was quite a bit more\"\" to the operation than simply revealing the\\nintelligence regarding Libya. He declined to discuss what he described as the second phase of the\\noperation.\\nHowever, already there is evidence that the first phase of the operation is underway. On Wednesday,\\nSeptember 26, on Pox News, Karl Rove called Obama\\'s reaction to what happened in Libya\\nxplicable\"\" and added that Obama is \"\"more intent on campaigning than meeting his\\nresponsibilities as commander-in-chief\"\" He went on to warn that Obarna\\'s policies in Libya\\nendangered the U.S. with regard to Iran. \"\"I am astonished,\"\" Rove said \"\"We are projecting weakness\\nwhen we need to be projecting strength.\"\"\\nSimilarly, former New York Mayor Rudolph Giuliani, a one-time GOP presidential hopeful who\\nbecame known as the mayor of 9/11, followed Rove in criticizing Obama on the attack in Libya. \"\"This\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739629\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

This is a cover-up that involves the slaughter of four\\nAmericans.\"\"\\nGiuliani added that the Obama White House wanted to dismiss the role played by al-Qaeda because it\\nseemed to diminish the triumph of having killed Osama bin Laden. \"\"I think it\\'s because they have this\\nnarrative that they defeated al-Qaeda,\"\" he said. \"\"They never say the words \\'Islamic fundamentalist\\nterrorism\\'. They want to wish it away. The president was moving on to Asia ??he was going to declare\\nthis a great victory for himself and unfortunately, this terrible act of terror intervened in their very\\nconvenient narrative.\"\"\\nLikewise, Bob Corker, Republican senator from Tennessee, described the administration\\'s response to\\n\"\"the terrorist attack\"\" in Libya as \"\"bizarre.\"\" And on Sunday, September 30, both Mitt Romney and\\nvice-presidential nominee Paul Ryan joined in the attacks. \"\"I think they want to do their very best to\\nkeep the people of America from understanding exactly what happened. We expect candor, we expect\\ntransparency, particularly as it relates to terrorism,\"\" Romney said.\\nAdded Ryan, \"\"Why is he (Obama) not on the same page with his own administration officials who are\\nsaying that this is a terrorist attack? We\\'ll leave it up to you to decide whether it\\'s a cover-up or not.\"\"\\nIn an apparently related development, a Politico article posted last night said Romney advisers were\\ndivided over how aggressively to attack President Obama over his handling of the events in Libya. One\\nunnamed Romney adviser described them as \"\"a huge gift\"\" to the campaign. \"\"Across the board ??domestic, economic and foreign-policy issues ??President Obama has been outmatched by events,\"\" he\\nsaid. \"\"He\\'s an observer of events, not a shaper of events. Everywhere you look, he\\'s been outmatched.\"\"\\nBut other Romney advisers, led by media strategist Stuart Stevens, wanted to stick to the economy as\\nthe central issue. \"\"They\\'ll tell you that you\\'ve got to focus people on the fact that their economic\\nprospects are not very good and all that,\"\" the aide told Politico. \"\"Well, Romney\\'s been trying to do that\\nnow since he clinched the nomination at the end of April ??and he\\'s failed. The president is better at\\ndeflecting attention from the bad news than Romney is at driving home the impact of the bad news on\\nindividual voters.\"\"\\nCraig Unger is the New York Times bestselling author of \"\"House of Bush, House of Saud,\"\" and a\\nfrequent analyst on CNN, ABC Radio, Air America, The Charlie Rose Show, NBC\\'s Today Show and\\nother broadcast outlets.

How has an episode that seemed at first to have been mishandled by\\nthe Romney camp become an emblem of a feckless and deluded foreign policy?\\nThe story-switching and stonewalling haven\\'t helped. But let\\'s start a little earlier.\\nThe hour is 5 p.m., Sept. 11, Washington time, and the scene is an Oval Office meeting among\\nPresident 째barna, the secretary of defense, the national security adviser and the chairman of\\nthe Joint Chiefs of Staff. The U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi has been under assault for\\nroughly 90 minutes. Some 30 U.S. citizens are at mortal risk. The whereabouts of Ambassador\\nStevens are unknown.\\nWhat is uppermost on the minds of the president and his advisers? The safety of Americans,\\nno doubt. So what are they prepared to do about it? Here is The Wall Street Journal\\'s account\\nof the meeting:\\n\"\"There was no serious consideration at that hour of intervention with military force, officials\\nsaid.

Yet the attack was far from over. After leaving the principal U.S. compound, the\\nAmericans retreated to a second, supposedly secret facility, which soon came under deadly\\nmortar fire. Time to call in the troops?\\n\"\"Some officials said the U.S. could also have sent aircraft to the scene as a \\'show of force\\' to\\nscare off the attackers,\"\" the Journal reported, noting that there\\'s a U.S. air base just 450 miles\\naway in Sicily. \"\"State Department officials dismissed the suggestions as unrealistic. \\'They\\nwould not have gotten there in two hours, four hours or six hours.\"\"\\nThe U.S. security detail only left Washington at 8 a.m. on Sept. 12, more than 10 hours after\\nthe attacks began. A commercial jet liner can fly from D.C. to Benghazi in about the same\\ntime.\\nAll this is noted with the benefit of hindsight, and the administration deserves to be judged\\naccordingly. But it also deserves to be judged in light of what it knew prior to the attack,\\nincluding an attack on the mission in June and heightened threat warnings throughout the\\nsummer.\\nSo how did the administration do on that count? \"\"That the local security did so well back in\\nJune probably gave us a false sense of security,\"\" an unnamed American official who has\\nserved in Libya told the New York Times last week.\\nThe logic here is akin to supposing that because the 1993 attack on the World Trade Center\\nfailed to bring down the towers, nobody need have been concerned thereafter. But let\\'s still\\nmake allowances for the kind of bureaucratic ineptitude that knows neither administration nor\\npolitical party.\\nThe more serious question is why the administration alighted on the idea that the attack wasn\\'t\\na terrorist act at all. Also, what did the White House think it had to gain by adopting the\\njihadist narrative that a supposedly inflammatory video clip was at the root of the trouble?\\nNobody can say. All the administration will acknowledge is that it has \"\"revised [its] initial\\nassessment to reflect new information that it was a deliberate and organized terrorist attack.\"\"\\nThat\\'s from James Clapper, the director of national intelligence. It suggests that our\\nintelligence agencies are either much dumber than previously supposed (always a strong\\npossibility) or much more politicized (equally plausible).\\nNo doubt the administration would now like to shift blame to Mr. Clapper. But what happened\\nin Benghazi was not a failure of intelligence. It was a failure of policy, stemming from a\\nflawed worldview and the political needs of an election season.\\nLet\\'s review:\\nThe U.S. ignores warnings of a parlous security situation in Benghazi. Nothing happens\\nbecause nobody is really paying attention, especially in an election year, and because Libya is\\nsupposed to be a foreign-policy success. When something does happen, the administration\\'s\\nconcerns for the safety of Americans are subordinated to considerations of Libyan\\n\"\"sovereignty\"\" and the need for \"\"permission.\"\" After the attack the administration blames a\\nvideo, perhaps because it would be politically inconvenient to note that al Qaeda is far from\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739633\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Every meeting started with condolences on Chris Stevens and his three\\ncolleagues, and concern that Benghazi would permanently alter US Libyan relations. I used the fact of the Secretary\\'s\\nmeeting with President Magaref in NY last week and Deputy secretary Burns\\' Tripoli visit as the best evidence of US\\ndetermination to continue To build the relationship with this new democracy. In addition:\\n- FBI INVESTIGATION: With the PM, DFM and Judicial leaders, I placed heavy emphasis on the importance of Libyan\\ncooperation and transparency in the investigation. This was my primary focus; I stressed the point that Libya\\'s\\nperformance will no doubt color American views on Libya at a time when Libya will want to burnish its reputation.\\n- SECURITY: I stressed that social stability and economic growth will depend on a dramatic improvement in security. All\\nagreed without\\nhesitation. All said that Libya needs outside assistance, but when we\\ndiscussed details of how to move forward on the bilateral programs we already have underway, each was quick to\\nidentify specific stumbling blocks on each Especially with the Acting FM, we also identified next steps.\\n- TRAINING: We made progress on 1208, CBW, and MANPADS training programs - details to follow front channel. We\\nwill also follow up on judicial exchanges and forensic training.\\n- NEW GOVT FORMATION: Abushagur described the negotiation process as the single most difficult professional\\nchallenge he has ever faced. He told us the government would be ready by October 3. Even though others warned us\\nhe would miss that deadline due to difficulty in reconciling the competing demands of various parties and individuals, he\\nobviously made good on his Oct. 3 announcement undertaking.\\n- DDR: Abushagur said there are three main groups of militants to\\nreintegrate: part have jobs, part are heading back to university, and part will be offered vocational training. He said he\\nwill create a new Ministry of Human Development to oversee DDR; it\\'s unclear how this new ministry will relate to\\nnumerous other GOL. efforts on this He expressed concern about the approximately 17,000 criminals released by\\nQacihafi, some of whom joined militias.\\n- TRANSITIONAL JUSTICE: The political leaders and judges all pledged to strike a balance between respecting the rights\\nof detainees and holding human rights violators accountable. They acknowledged the profound limitations of their\\njustice system.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739635\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

And the point of education is to shake us out of that \"\"default setting\"\" ??to\\nbegin to see things from the perspectives of others.\\nFollow the CNN Belief Blog on Twitter\\nWallace focused in his speech on the individual \"\"I.\"\" But his critique can be applied as well to another \"\"default\\nsetting\"\" (this one more cultural than natural): our tendency to understand the world from the perspective of\\n\"\"we.11\\nAccording to those who stormed the embassies, \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\" was not made by an individual\\n(whoever the shadowy \"\"Sam Bacile\"\" may ??or may not ??be). It was made by anAmerican.\\nMoreover, according to this groupthink, Americans as a group are responsible for the sins of individual\\nAmericans, so it makes perfect sense to strike out at embassy personnel who issued a statement before the\\nprotests turned deadly, condemning \"\"the continuing efforts by misguided individuals to hurt the religious\\nfeelings of Muslims, as we condemn efforts to offend believers of all religions.\"\"\\nCNN\\'s Belief Blog: The faith angles behind the biggest stories\\nMeanwhile, the shadowy figures who produced and distributed \"\"Innocence of Muslims\"\" are imprisoned in some\\ngroupthink of their own, which gathers all the world\\'s Muslims under the category of an evil Islamic empire.\\nTheir film doesn\\'t just depict Mohammed as a con man, philanderer, and pedophile. It portrays his followers as\\ndupes.\\nUnfortunately, the events of recent days have done nothing to jar the alleged producer out of this default setting.\\nWhen questioned about his film in the aftermath of the Libyan and Egyptian attacks, a man identifying himself\\nas \"\"Sam Bacile\"\" reportedly told the Wall Street Journal that \"\"Islam is a cancer.\"\"\\nYou don\\'t need a Kenyon college degree to see how this vicious cycle of provocation and violence is fueled,\\nand you don\\'t need to be a moral relativist to see that it takes two sides to keep it running.\\nI am an American who is justly proud of the First Amendment and its protections of freedom of speech and\\nreligion. And I believe that killing your opponents in the name of God or nation is a far greater offense than\\noffending them with an ignorant movie.\\nNonetheless, the root problem on display here is in my view what Wallace denounced as \"\"blind certainty.\"\"\\nOur world is not divided first and foremost along religious or national lines, into Muslims and Christians and\\nHindus or Israelis and Americans and Egyptians.\\nNeither is it divided into secularists and people of faith ??the New Atheists and partisans of old-time religion.\\nThe real \"\"red line\"\" in the modern world divides the certain from the uncertain. And in the tragic events of recent\\ndays, those who produced and distributed this hateful movie stand on the same side of this line as the killers of\\ninnocents in Libya and Egypt.\\nBoth groups are possessed by the unholy spirit of \"\"blind certainty,\"\" unacquainted with both the complexity and\\ncontradictions of life on Earth and the \"\"cloud of unknowing\"\" that hovers over every major religion.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739640\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya\\ntold senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa\\nAbushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan\\nGovernment. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the\\nMuslim Brotherhood\\'s (MB) Justice and Construction Party (jCP), as well as certain of the other\\nmore traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new\\ngovernment while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.\\n2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party\\nholding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately\\nafter Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to\\ninclude in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril\\'s National Forces\\nAlliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time\\nMagariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;\\nhowever, he did point out that even Jibril\\'s more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a\\nmodern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet . The President came away from this\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739643\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

NO FOIA WAIVER.\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739643\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\ndiscussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and\\nthe 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with\\nthe 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This\\nindividual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice\\nPresident and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.\\n3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in\\nthe Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire\\nof the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to\\nbalance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a\\ncabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually\\nleave him as the dominant figure in the government.)\\n4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security\\nsituation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United\\nStates Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,\\nrebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya\\nsafely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the\\ncabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman\\nBen Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian\\nOil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this\\nindividual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of\\nMabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya\\'s Zueitina Oil\\nCompany as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the\\nstanding among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable\\nto a number of the conservative members of the GNC.\\n5.

In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA\\nministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter.

In this\\nregard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the\\nlargest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies\\nwith the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social\\nmatters, while focusing primarily on local political issues.

Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet\\nAbushagur plans to put forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other\\nmoderate groups, it will still be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again\\nfail to gain acceptance, leading to a real government crisis.\\n6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more\\nthan 100 protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs\\nfrom convening to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these\\nprotesters he did nothing to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular,\\nthe protestors objected to the failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya\\nregion. Although the demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs,\\nwho had said they would support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their\\npositions. In the end, according to this individual, Abushagur\\'s efforts to rally their support\\nfailed, and he was forced to withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on\\nOctober 7, one that would take into account regional and political considerations.\\n7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any\\nNFA ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf\\nis concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government.\\nIn this regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA\\nholds the largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the\\nparliament lies with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on\\nreligious and social matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes\\nthat the appointment of Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would\\nserve to reassure Western business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance\\nto the Libyan people. Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication\\nthat Abushagur will follow his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of\\ncabinet ministers associated with the MB and the JCP.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739644\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Sid\\nCONFIDENTIAL\\nOctober 6, 2012\\nFor: Hillary\\nFrom: Sid\\nRe: Libya cabinet politics\\nSOURCE: Sources with direct access to the Libyan National Transitional Council, as well as the\\nhighest levels of European Governments, and Western Intelligence and security services.\\n1.As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya\\ntold senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa\\nAbushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan\\nGovernment. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the\\nMuslim Brotherhood\\'s (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other\\nmore traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new\\ngovernment while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.\\n2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party\\nholding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately\\nafter Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739647\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

At that time\\nMagariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;\\nhowever, he did point out that even Jibril\\'s more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a\\nmodern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this\\ndiscussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and\\nthe 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with\\nthe 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This\\nindividual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice\\nPresident and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.\\n3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in\\nthe Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire\\nof the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to\\nbalance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a\\ncabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually\\nleave him as the dominant figure in the government.)\\n4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security\\nsituation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United\\nStates Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,\\nrebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya\\nsafely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to replace the\\ncabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil Abdulrahman\\nBen Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al Qaddafi, and the Italian\\nOil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative parties. That said, this\\nindividual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of\\nMabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya\\'s Zueitina Oil\\nCompany as well as in the oil sector abroad. Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the\\nstanding among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable\\nto a number of the conservative members of the GNC.\\n5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and\\ndemonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President\\nagain advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry\\npost; however, he fears that that All Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739647\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put\\nforward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still\\nbe dominated by the JCF\\' and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to\\na real government crisis.\\n6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than loo\\nprotesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening\\nto vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing\\nto warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular, the protestors objected to the\\nfailure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the\\ndemonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would\\nsupport the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,\\naccording to this individual, Abushagur\\'s efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to\\nwithdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into\\naccount regional and political considerations.\\n7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA\\nministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is\\nconcerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this\\nregard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the\\nlargest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies\\nwith the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social\\nmatters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of\\nAli Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western\\nbusiness and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.\\nAlthough he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow\\nhis advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of cabinet ministers associated with\\nthe MB and the JCP.\\n8. (Source Comment: In the opinion of this individual, Magariaf will remain focused on the security\\nsituation, particularly as he is having some success disarming the militias following the death of the U.S.\\nAmbassador. According to this individual, Magariaf believes he must end the power of the regional militia\\nforces before the Libyan economy can improve. The President knows that foreign companies are the key to\\nLibyan oil production, but he fears that they will not increase their commitment to Libya until the government\\ncan insure the security of their personnel and facilities.

As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of\\nLibya told senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister\\nMustafa Abushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the\\nnew Libyan Government. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that\\nAbushagur, supported by the Muslim Brotherhood\\'s (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP),\\nas well as certain of the other more traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day\\nadministrative control the new government while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of\\nState.\\n2. According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party\\nholding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister\\nimmediately after Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf\\nadvised him to include in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril\\'s\\nNational Forces Alliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC\\nvote. At that time Magariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet\\nseats for the NFA; however, he did point out that even Jibril\\'s more moderate followers were\\ncommitted to the idea of a modern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet.

This individual added that Abushagur made it\\nclear that while the President was free to choose his Vice President and staff, the Prime Minister\\nwould choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.\\n3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current\\ncrisis in the Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced\\nthat the desire of the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added\\nto the need to balance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the\\nformation of a cabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these\\ndevelopments will eventually leave him as the dominant figure in the government.)\\n4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security\\nsituation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the\\nUnited States Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important\\nrole, rebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in\\nLibya safely and efficiently. To this end he does agree with Abushagur that it is important to\\nreplace the cabinet of former Prime Minister Abdel Rahman el-Keib, particularly Minister of Oil\\nAbdulrahman Ben Yazza, whose connections to the regime of former dictator Muammar al\\nQaddafi, and the Italian Oil firm ENI made him unacceptable to the JCP and other conservative\\nparties. That said, this individual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the\\nappointment to the ministry of Mabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who\\npreviously worked for Libya\\'s Zueitina Oil Company as well as in the oil sector abroad.\\nMagariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the standing among the foreign oil companies\\nthat Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable to a number of the conservative\\nmembers of the GNC.\\n5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs\\nand demonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations.

Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet\\nAbushagur plans to put forward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other\\nmoderate groups, it will still be dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again\\nfail to gain acceptance, leading to a real government crisis.\\n6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more\\nthan 100 protesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs\\nfrom convening to vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these\\nprotesters he did nothing to warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular,\\nthe protestors objected to the failure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya\\nregion. Although the demonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs,\\nwho had said they would support the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their\\npositions. In the end, according to this individual, Abushagur\\'s efforts to rally their support\\nfailed, and he was forced to withdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on\\nOctober 7, one that would take into account regional and political considerations.\\n7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any\\nNFA ministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf\\nis concerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government.\\nIn this regard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA\\nholds the largest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the\\nparliament lies with the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on\\nreligious and social matters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes\\nthat the appointment of Ali Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would\\nserve to reassure Western business and government leaders while demonstrating political balance\\nto the Libyan people. Although he continues to make this point, the President has no indication\\nthat Abushagur will follow his advice. He does expect Abushagur to again select a majority of\\ncabinet ministers associated with the MB and the JCP.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739647\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

Magariaf feels that Abu Harroura does not have the\\nstanding among the foreign oil companies that Ben Yezza enjoyed, although he was more acceptable\\nto a number of the conservative members of the GNC.\\n5. Magariaf was pleased that the Prime Minister, after dramatic confrontations with MPs and\\ndemonstrators who entered the GNC chamber, withdrew his cabinet nominations. The President\\nagain advised Abushagur to name former Oil and Finance Minister Ali Tarhouni to the Oil Ministry\\npost; however, he fears that that Ali Tarhouni is seen as too close to Western governments to gain\\nacceptance in the GNC. Magariaf is concerned that, while the new cabinet Abushagur plans to put\\nforward on October 7 may contain some members of the NFA and other moderate groups, it will still\\nbe dominated by the JCP and conservative elements, and will again fail to gain acceptance, leading to\\na real government crisis.\\n6. According to this individual Magariaf and his advisors knew in advance that more than mo\\nprotesters planned to enter the GNC session on October 4, in an effort to prevent MPs from convening\\nto vote on the new cabinet. While Magariaf did not directly influence these protesters he did nothing\\nto warn or advise Abushagur on the developing situation. In particular, the protestors objected to the\\nfailure of the Prime Minister to name any minister from the Zawiya region. Although the\\ndemonstrators eventually left the hall, a number of the independent MPs, who had said they would\\nsupport the new cabinet, were shaken by the incident and changed their positions. In the end,\\naccording to this individual, Abushagur\\'s efforts to rally their support failed, and he was forced to\\nwithdraw all of the nominees, promising to submit a new list on October 7, one that would take into\\naccount regional and political considerations.\\n7. In the opinion of a particularly sensitive source, the failure of Abushagur to name any NFA\\nministers to the new cabinet will continue to complicate the matter. For his part Magariaf is\\nconcerned over international perceptions regarding the nature of the new Libyan government. In this\\nregard, he fears that the Western press is too sharply focused on the fact that the NFA holds the\\nlargest single bloc of votes in the GNC (38), missing the fact that the real power in the parliament lies\\nwith the 120 independent deputies, who tend to be somewhat conservative on religious and social\\nmatters, while focusing primarily on local political issues. Magariaf believes that the appointment of\\nAli Tarhouni, or another liberal not associated with the NFA, would serve to reassure Western\\nbusiness and government leaders while demonstrating political balance to the Libyan people.\\nAlthough he continues to make this point, the President has no indication that Abushagur will follow\\nhis advice.

As of October 5, 2012 Mohammed Yussef el Magariaf, the new interim President of Libya\\ntold senior advisors that the abortive efforts to form a cabinet under new Prime Minister Mustafa\\nAbushagur represent the first step in the next phase of the struggle for control of the new Libyan\\nGovernment. According to a sensitive source Magariaf is concerned that Abushagur, supported by the\\nMuslim Brotherhood\\'s (MB) Justice and Construction Party (JCP), as well as certain of the other\\nmore traditional Islamist groups, is looking to establish day to day administrative control the new\\ngovernment while defining Magariaf as a ceremonial Head of State.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739651\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

According to this individual, the President, who is not affiliated with a particular party\\nholding seats in the General National Council (GNC), spoke with the new Prime Minister immediately\\nafter Abushagur was elected by the GNC on September 12. At that time Magariaf advised him to\\ninclude in his government members of former Prime Minister Mahmoud Jibril\\'s National Forces\\nAlliance (NFA), Abushagar having only narrowly defeated Jibril in the GNC vote. At that time\\nMagariaf was not aware of the fact that Jibril had already demanded 9 cabinet seats for the NFA;\\nhowever, he did point out that even Jibril\\'s more moderate followers were committed to the idea of a\\nmodern Islamic state and would fit into the new cabinet. The President came away from this\\ndiscussion with the impression that Abushagur and his supporters intend to marginalize Jibril and\\nthe 39 Members of Parliament (MP) controlled by the NFA, concentrating instead on working with\\nthe 120 independent MPs in the GNC, looking to establish a more conservative administration. This\\nindividual added that Abushagur made it clear that while the President was free to choose his Vice\\nPresident and staff, the Prime Minister would choose the national cabinet, supported by the GNC.\\n3. (Source Comment: According to this individual, Magariaf is allowing the current crisis in\\nthe Abushagur administration to play out without direct interference. He is convinced that the desire\\nof the Libyan people for peace and stability, which brought him to power, added to the need to\\nbalance the regional and political rivalries throughout the country, will lead to the formation of a\\ncabinet that is acceptable to all parties. Magariaf also believes that these developments will eventually\\nleave him as the dominant figure in the government.)\\n4. In addition, this individual added that Magariaf is seized with the national security\\nsituation, the ongoing effort to disarm militia units, and the investigation of the murder of the United\\nStates Ambassador. All of these efforts are related to what he sees as his most important role,\\nrebuilding the confidence of the international business community in its ability to operate in Libya\\nsafely and efficiently.

That said, this\\nindividual notes that Magariaf was surprised and not pleased with the appointment to the ministry of\\nMabrouk Issa Abu Harroura, another technical expert, who previously worked for Libya\\'s Zueitina Oil\\nCompany as well as in the oil sector abroad.

These individuals add that they have been informed\\nby contacts in France and Italy that while they have been engaged in discussions with the LNC regarding possible\\nassistance, British diplomats and intelligence officers have maintained contact with members of the Qaddafi government\\nin an effort to protect the British position in the event the rebellion settles into a stalemate. These LNC officials believe\\nthat the defection of Libyan Minister of Foreign Affairs Mouse Kousa to the United Kingdom was part of this effort. By the\\nsame token they believe that British intelligence officers are in discussion with associates of Saif akislarn Qaddafi,\\nregarding future relations between the two countries if he takes over power from his father and implements reforms.\\nAccording to these individuals, senior LNC military personnel suspect that despite early indications that they would\\nprovide clandestine military support to the rebels; neither the French nor the British government will provide the rebels\\nwith enough equipment and training to defeat Qaddafi\\'s forces. They also believe that the French, British, and other\\nEuropean countries will be satisfied with a stalemate that leaves Libya divided into two rival entities.\\n(Source Comment: In the opinion of these individuals the LNC military leaders are considering the possibility of hiring\\nprivate secunty firms to help train and organize their forces. One of these individuals added that a number of the LNC\\nmembers believe that this solution may be best for the rebels; noting that if they accept clandestine aid from France\\nand/or Great Britain those two countries will be in a position to control the development of post Qaddafi Libya.)\\nLIBYA - INSURGENT ACTIVITY\\n(This information is based on sensitive reporting from individuals with direct access to the leadership ofthe\\nLNC.)\\n1. With little hope of achieving a quick military victory, the LNC is deploying a three part strategy; leveraging tribal\\nrelationships, oil production and diplomatic pressure to get the better of Qaddafi. A former spokesman for the Libyan\\nHuman Rights League (LHRL) in Europe, Ali Zidane, is in talks with representatives of tribes in Sebha and Sine in an\\neffort to persuade them to rally to the revolution and the LNG before fighting actually reaches their regions. Zidane is a\\ncandidate to be the Minister of the Interior in the new Libya.\"\" Among his close associates is Mohamed Allagui, president\\nof the LHRL, who is interested in the justice portfolio in the future, transition government.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739654\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

The LNC\\nbelieves that the U.S will focus on restarting operations at the oil terminal in Tobruk. and an American envoy is expected\\nin Benghazi in the near future to facilitate this process. For its part, Qatar is advancing cash to the LNC to stimulate the\\nshipment of oil from eastern Libya. Some commodity traders stepped in recently (under contract from Qatar) to deliver\\nrefined oil products to the insurgents. VITOL and the Swiss firm GLENCORE are operating in the rebel zone, but denied\\nany involvement in this shipment.\\nElsewhere, these sources add that Mahmud Shammarn is overseeing the information and communications campaign for\\nthe rebels against Qaddafi. Considered one of the LNC most important leaders, Sharnmam brings to the insurgency the\\nexpertise he acquired while working for Voice of America, Foreign Policy, Newsweek and Al Jazeera. Shammam lived in\\nthe U.S. for more than twenty years, and he is believed to have excellent connections in the U.S. Government.\\n3. Islamist activity: Libya\\'s Islamist activists have maintained a low profile since the start of the insurgency in late\\nFebruary; fearing that their activities would give credence to Qaddafi\\'s claims that the rebeis are terrorists. As the LNC is\\ntaking shape, they are now working to make their voice heard, and influence events within the LNC. Ali Sallabi, Salem Al\\nShiki and Mohamed Al Guirtili, leading Islamic figures who had taken refuge in London (and are close to the Moslem\\nBrotherhood), drafted a \\'national pact\"\" which looks like a road map for organizing the role of the Islamist movement in the\\ntransition to a post ??Qaddafi Libya.\\nSallabi and his two associates draw their inspiration from the \"\"February 17 Movement which helped spark the uprising by\\ncommemorating the massacre of Islamist prisoners at the Abu Salim prison in 1996. Prior to the current rebellion,\\nMustapha Abdel Jalil, the President of the LNC and former Minister of Justice called for the release of reformed Islamists.\\nAt present, the Islamists are handicapped by the fact they supported Sail\\'s reform projects before the recent crisis. Saif\\nplayed a crucial part in getting the Islamists to sever ties between the Libyan Islamic Fighting Group\\'s and al Qa\\'ida in the\\nIslamic Maghreb (AQIM).\\nEGYPT AND LIBYA:\\nA source with excellent access to the highest levels of the SUPREME COUNCIL OF THE ARMED FORCES (SCAF)\\nstates that the Egyptian Military has turned its full attention to the crisis in Libya. Traditionally, Egypt is a strong influence\\nin the eastern Libyan region of Cyreriaica and is now taking advantage of the current crisis to regain that position.\\nRegardless of whether Muammar Qaddafi remains in power or not, the political division of Libya will give Egypt the\\nopportunity to fill the void in the east. A senior diplomatic source reported that since the early days of the Libyan crisis, the\\nEgyptian government has been quietly supporting Libyan opposition forces through training, weaponry, food, and medical\\nsupplies, while attempting to organize a political structure in the east. In addition, Egyptian Special Operations troops are\\nserving with rebel forces in the eastern part of Libya. Senior Egyptian military officers stated privately that these troops\\nare responsible for many of the rebel\\'s combat successes.\\nThe following factors are the focus of Egypt\\'s plans for a post-Qaddafi regime:\\n-Avoiding a refugee crisis. In the event Qaddafi\\'s forces invade the east, Egypt is the most logical destination for\\nrefugees from Libyan. Egypt has an interest in controlling any turmoil in Libya that could harm efforts to restart its\\nstruggling economy.\\n-Labor market. Libya is an important market for unemployed Egyptian laborers. According to the Egyptian Labor\\nMinistry, around 1.5 million Egyptians reside and work in Libya, sending home an estimated $254 million in remittances\\nIn the past few years, Qaddafi has placed heavy restrictions on foreign workers, and Egypt hopes that a new regime will\\nbe more flexible, and open to receiving Egyptian workers.\\n-Radical Islamists. Traditionally, the eastern part of Libya has been a stronghold for radical Islamist groups, including\\nthe al Qaida-linked Libyan Islamic Fighting Group While Qaddafi\\'s regime has been successful in suppressing the\\njihadist threat in Libya, the current situation opens the door for jihadist resurgence. Egypt has a growing interest in\\nkeeping a close eye on jrhadist movements in eastern Libya. This is especially true as the Egyptian Military is already\\nconcerned about Islamist militancy overflow from Gaza, after their forces were pulled back to Cairo during the uprising\\nagainst Mubarak.\\n-Oil and energy resources. Egypt has strong economic interests in the oil rich eastern part of Libya. Any opportunity to\\ngain direct or indirect access to these energy resources will increase Egypt\\'s wealth.\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739654\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

So\\nfar, Egypt has fostered discussions in the Palestinian territories between Fatah and Homes, while reaching out to Syria\\nand Saudi Arabia on the issue of Iran.\\n(Source Comment: According to a sensitive diplomatic source, the current Egyptian diplomatic strategy is to enhance its\\nstature by defending the Libyan people against Qaddafi\\'s regime, while at the same time, distancing itself from any\\nmilitary intervention led by the region\\'s former colonial powers in Europe.)\\nIt should be noted that, in the opinion of knowledgeable sources, Egypt cannot count on the support of every Arab power\\nin the region. Egypt led the call for imposing the no-fly zone in Libya, while Algeria, while Yemen, and Syria voted against\\nit. These countries (especially Yemen) fear the precedence that would be created for their own governments in the event\\nQaddafi is ousted.\\n(Source Comment: A source with access to the leadership of NATO state in confidence that their information indicates\\nthat Syria and Algeria are concerned with Egypt\\'s revival in the region. This source stated that a de facto split between\\neastern and western Libya would give Egypt the opportunity to reassume an influential position in Cyrenaica.)\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739654\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

This latest assault cannot be blamed on a reprehensible video insulting Islam,\\ndespite the administration\\'s attempts to convince us of that for so long. No, as the administration has finally\\nconceded, these attacks were the deliberate work of terrorists who use violence to impose their dark ideology on\\nothers, especially women and girls; who are fighting to control much of the Middle East today; and who seek to\\nwage perpetual war on the West.\"\"\\nSome in the U.S. intelligence community believe that the attack on the Benghazi consulate that killed Amb.\\nChris Stevens and three other Americans was led by the Benghazi chapter of Ansar al-Sharia, an extremist group\\nthought to have ties to Al Qaeda in the Islamic Magreb (AQIM), al Qaeda\\'s North Africa affiliate.\\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton suggested that groups with links to AQIM were responsible for the Beghazi\\nattack in remarks at a U.N. meeting on Sept. 26, but State Department and White House spokepersons have\\nrepeated again and again that the precise identity of the attackers remains unknown pending an FBI investigation.\\nRomney will invoke the original 9/n attacks as part of his argument that Obama has failed to respond to the rapid\\nchanges in the Middle East with a proactive and coherent strategy to preserve American power and influence in the\\nregion.\\n\"\"I know the president hopes for a safer, freer, and a more prosperous Middle East allied with the United States. I\\nshare this hope. But hope is not a strategy,\"\" Romney will say. \"\"We cannot support our friends and defeat our\\nenemies in the Middle East when our words are not backed up by deeds, when our defense spending is being\\narbitrarily and deeply cut, when we have no trade agenda to speak of, and the perception of our strategy is not one\\nof partnership, but of passivity.... It is time to change course in the Middle East.\"\"\\nRomney will promise to increase and tighten sanctions against Iran, permanently base one aircraft carrier group\\neach in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Gulf, condition aid to Egypt, and \"\"recommit America to the goal of a\\ndemocratic, prosperous Palestinian state living side by side in peace and security with the Jewish state of Israel.\"\"\\nOn Syria, Romney will promise to identify opposition groups that share American values and make sure they get\\nweapons to defeat the Syrian regime\\'s tanks, helicopters, and fighter jets. He won\\'t say that the United States should\\narm the rebels directly -- only that it should make sure they get advanced weaponry.\\nOn Afghanistan, Romney will accuse Obama of timing the withdrawal of U.S. forces based on political\\nconsiderations, a reference to the fact that Obama withdrew all 30,000 \"\"surge\"\" forces last month. But Romney will\\nreiterate his call to complete the withdrawal of combat troops by the end of 2014, so long as the conditions on the\\nground permit and in consultation with the military chain of command.\\n\"\"I believe that if America does not lead, others will -- others who do not share our interests and our values -- and the\\nworld will grow darker, for our friends and for us.

A seven minute portion of the\\nmovie aired on an Egyptian TV talk show the weekend before the protests started, according to a Department of\\nHomeland Security/Federal Bureau of Intelligence memo obtained by CNN on Thursday.\\nThe cable was not sent to the embassy in Tripoli, Libya or the consulate in Benghazi. US officials have said\\nthere was no intelligence ahead of the attack in Benghazi, which intelligence officials still believe was not\\nplanned. The White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday there was no \"\"actionable intelligence\"\" indicating\\nan attack was being planned.\\nThere are hundreds if not thousands of cables sent each day, the official said, and there was no specific threat\\nattached to this one, because a specific threat was not known\\nUNCLASSIFIED\\nU.S. Department of State\\nCase No. F-2015-04841\\nDoc No. C05739658\\nDate: 05/13/2015\\nSTATE DEPT. - PRODUCED TO HOUSE SELECT BENGHAZI COMM.\\nSUBJECT TO AGREEMENT ON SENSITIVE INFORMATION & REDACTIONS.

House Republicans, whose brand is not exactly soaring with voters, are making a huge\\nmistake using congressional hearings as a partisan weapon to exploit a national tragedy to attack one of the\\nmost admired and respected public servants in the nation.\\nThere is now an independent and nonpartisan investigation of exactly what happened in Libya. A partisan\\nwitch-hunt by Republicans using taxpayer money against Secretary Clinton, as a partisan weapon in the closing\\ndays of an election, to exploit a tragedy to score political points is exactly what the American people believe\\nhas gone wrong with Washington, and is exactly why the Republican brand is in such disrepute with many\\nvoters.'"
